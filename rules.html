        <h2>Blackjack</h2>
        <div class="rule">
            <h3>Basic rules of blackjack:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Blackjack starts with players making bets.</li>
                <li>Dealer deals 2 cards to the players and two to himself (1 card face up, the other face down).</li>
                <li>Blackjack card values: All cards count their face value in blackjack. Picture cards count as 10 and
                    the ace can count as either 1 or 11. Card suits have no meaning in blackjack. The total of any hand
                    is the sum of the card values in the hand.
                </li>
                <li>Players must decide whether to stand, hit, surrender, double down, or split.</li>
                <li>The dealer acts last and must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 through 21.</li>
                <li>Players win when their hand totals higher than dealerâ€™s hand, or they have 21 or less when the
                    dealer busts (i.e., exceeds 21).
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Blackjack card values:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>JACK, QUEEN and KING count as 10</li>
                <li>ACE count as 1 or 11</li>
                <li>Other cards counts as their face value</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Poker / 5 card draw</h2>
        <div class="rule">
            <h3>The Deal and First Round of Betting</h3>
            <p>Once the buy-in amount is determinated, the game begins. With 5 Card Draw, five cards are dealt face down
                to each player in the hand, starting with the player to the left of the dealer.</p>

            <p>After the cards are dealt, the first round of betting ensues. Starting with the player to the left of
                the dealer, each player has the option to fold their hand, call the current bet or raise it up! If no
                one raises, the first player has the option to check their hand, meaning that player makes no
                bet but still retains their hand.</p>
            <p>The amount you can bet or raise is determined by the betting structure of the game you're playing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the game is <b>No Limit</b>, you can bet all of your chips at any point in the hand</li>
                <li>If the game is <b>Pot Limit</b>, you can bet up to the size of the pot at any point in the hand</li>
                <li>If the game is <b>Fixed Limit</b>, you can bet in increments of a predetermined betting limit that
                    corresponds to the size of the blinds
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Draw</h3>
            <p>When the first round of betting is complete, all players still in the hand have the option to discard
                any or all of their cards and draw new ones. Click on the cards you want to discard, and then click the
                Draw button when it's your turn to act.</p>

            <p>If you prefer not to discard any cards, you have the option to "stand pat". To do so, click the Stand
                button when it's your turn to act.</p>

            <p>Once all players have discarded, new cards will be drawn from the deck and each player will be dealt the
                same number of cards which they discarded.
            </p>

            <h3>The Final Round of Betting and Showdown</h3>
            <p>After the draw, a final round of betting takes place, beginning with the first player to the left of the
                dealer. If no one has bet, you have the option to check your hand or make a bet. If you're facing a bet,
                you have the option to fold, call or raise.</p>

            <p>At the showdown, the player with the best high hand wins the pot. If there is a tie for the best hand,
                the pot will be split equally among the tied players. Occasionally the pot cannot be split evenly among
                all players. If there are any remaining chips left in the pot, the 'extra' chips will be awarded one at
                a time to the remaining players, starting with the player closest to the left of the button.</p>

            <p>Sometimes a player runs out of chips before all the betting is over. In such case, one or more side pots
                are created, and the software awards appropriate main and side pots. When a player is all in, a bet or
                raise can be made that is not called, but a showdown still takes place.</p>

            <p>Players often do not show losing hands.</p>
