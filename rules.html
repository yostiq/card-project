        <h2>Blackjack</h2>
        <div class="rule">
            <h3>Basic rules of blackjack:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Blackjack starts with players making bets.</li>
                <li>Dealer deals 2 cards to the players and two to himself (1 card face up, the other face down).</li>
                <li>Blackjack card values: All cards count their face value in blackjack. Picture cards count as 10 and
                    the ace can count as either 1 or 11. Card suits have no meaning in blackjack. The total of any hand
                    is the sum of the card values in the hand.
                </li>
                <li>Players must decide whether to stand, hit, surrender, double down, or split.</li>
                <li>The dealer acts last and must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 through 21.</li>
                <li>Players win when their hand totals higher than dealer’s hand, or they have 21 or less when the
                    dealer busts (i.e., exceeds 21).
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Blackjack card values:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>JACK, QUEEN and KING count as 10</li>
                <li>ACE count as 1 or 11</li>
                <li>Other cards counts as their face value</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Poker / 5 card draw</h2>
        <div class="rule">
            <h3>The Deal and First Round of Betting</h3>
            <p>Once the buy-in amount is determinated, the game begins. With 5 Card Draw, five cards are dealt face down
                to each player in the hand, starting with the player to the left of the dealer.</p>

            <p>After the cards are dealt, the first round of betting ensues. Starting with the player to the left of
                the dealer, each player has the option to fold their hand, call the current bet or raise it up! If no
                one raises, the first player has the option to check their hand, meaning that player makes no
                bet but still retains their hand.</p>
            <p>The amount you can bet or raise is determined by the betting structure of the game you're playing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the game is <b>No Limit</b>, you can bet all of your chips at any point in the hand</li>
                <li>If the game is <b>Pot Limit</b>, you can bet up to the size of the pot at any point in the hand</li>
                <li>If the game is <b>Fixed Limit</b>, you can bet in increments of a predetermined betting limit that
                    corresponds to the size of the blinds
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Draw</h3>
            <p>When the first round of betting is complete, all players still in the hand have the option to discard
                any or all of their cards and draw new ones. Click on the cards you want to discard, and then click the
                Draw button when it's your turn to act.</p>

            <p>If you prefer not to discard any cards, you have the option to "stand pat". To do so, click the Stand
                button when it's your turn to act.</p>

            <p>Once all players have discarded, new cards will be drawn from the deck and each player will be dealt the
                same number of cards which they discarded.
            </p>

            <h3>The Final Round of Betting and Showdown</h3>
            <p>After the draw, a final round of betting takes place, beginning with the first player to the left of the
                dealer. If no one has bet, you have the option to check your hand or make a bet. If you're facing a bet,
                you have the option to fold, call or raise.</p>

            <p>At the showdown, the player with the best high hand wins the pot. If there is a tie for the best hand,
                the pot will be split equally among the tied players. Occasionally the pot cannot be split evenly among
                all players. If there are any remaining chips left in the pot, the 'extra' chips will be awarded one at
                a time to the remaining players, starting with the player closest to the left of the button.</p>

            <p>Sometimes a player runs out of chips before all the betting is over. In such case, one or more side pots
                are created, and the software awards appropriate main and side pots. When a player is all in, a bet or
                raise can be made that is not called, but a showdown still takes place.</p>

            <p>Players often do not show losing hands.</p>

        <h2>Texas Hold'em</h2>
        <div class="rule">
            <p>Texas Hold 'em is probably the best known and most popular form of poker today. As in most forms of
                poker, Texas Hold’em uses a standard 52-card deck that is shuffled before every hand.</p>
            <p>Each player starts with two hole cards. There are three rounds of community cards. These are dealt face
                up, for every player to use, with betting after each round.</p>
            <p>The best 5-card hand using any combination of the five community cards and two hole cards wins.</p>

            <h3>Blinds</h3>
            <p>Each hand of Hold 'em starts with two blinds. Blinds are preliminary bets made by two players before
                cards are dealt for the purpose of stimulating action. If there was nothing to win, the first player to
                make a decision would have no reason to make a bet. The deal position is indicated by a disk called the
                dealer button, or simply, the button. This is the position from which the dealer would distribute cards
                if the dealer were one of the players. Prior to cards being distributed, the player to the left of the
                button puts in chips equal to (usually) half the size of the minimum bet for the game (known as the
                small blind). The player to that player's left puts in chips equal to the minimum bet for the game
                (known as the big blind).</p>

            <h3>First Round</h3>
            <p>When the blinds are in place, the dealer distributes first one card and then another face down to each
                player, starting with the small blind. These two starting cards are called hole cards. Your hole cards
                appear face up on screen, but don't worry; only you can see your hole cards. Only the backs of every
                other player's hole cards appear on screen. Every other player has a similar view, with only his own
                hole cards visible.</p>
            <p>Each player starts with two cards, and then five cards are placed face-up in the center of the table.
                These community cards are part of each player's hand, so each player has access to seven cards. Each
                player tries to make the best possible poker hand by using five of the seven cards. Since a poker hand
                consists of exactly five cards, only the best five of the seven cards play. Even if you haven't had
                experience with Hold 'em, you don't have to worry which are the best cards; the software automatically
                chooses the best five for you when it comes time to compare hands.</p>
            <p>Hold 'em, as any form of poker, is about betting. Hold 'em has four betting rounds. The sizes of the bets
                depend on the structure of the game, of which Hold 'em has three possibilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Limit game – in Limit Texas Hold'em, each betting round has a fixed bet size.</li>
                <li>Pot-Limit game – in Pot Limit Texas Hold’em, a player can bet any amount from the minimum bet to the
                    size of the pot
                </li>
                <li>No-Limit game – in No Limit Texas Hold 'em, a player can bet any amount from the minimum bet to the
                    maximum number of chips they have in front of them
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The betting on the first round always starts with the player just to the left of the big blind. This
                position is sometimes called under the gun. As the first player to act, you have three choices. You
                can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fold</li>
                <li>Call for the minimum (limp)</li>
                <li>Open for a raise</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You choose your action by clicking in a dialog box. If you fold at any point, your cards are removed from
                play and no longer appear on the screen, you are out until the next hand, and you have no further
                interest in the pot. If you fold, the next player has the same choices. If everyone folds, including the
                small blind, the pot goes to the big blind, and the next hand is dealt.</p>
            <p>If you or anyone else opens, each succeeding player has three choices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fold</li>
                <li>Call, that is, match the preceding bet</li>
                <li>Raise, that is, increase the preceding bet></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each player in turn has the same three choices. If there has been a raise, each player who chooses to
                continue must either call the total bet thus far or raise. When the betting (also called action) gets to
                the blinds, they have the same choices. However, they already have chips in the pot, and those chips
                count towards their bet. If there have been no raises when the bets gets to the big blind, that player has what is
                called the option. He can opt to raise, in which case each active player in turn is offered a choice of
                calling the raise or reraising or folding. The big blind can also choose not to raise, which stops the
                betting for that round. The big blind in this option situation is known in poker parlance as a live
                blind.</p>
            <h3>The Flop</h3>
            <p>Once the betting for the round is equalized, that is, once everyone has had an opportunity either to fold
                or match the total betting, the dealer deals three cards face up in the center of the table. These first
                three of the community cards are called the flop.</p>
            <p>The second round of betting takes place. In this round, the betting starts with the first active player
                (one who still has cards) to the left of the button. If the small blind called on the first round, that
                player would be first to act, even though he was next-to-last on the first round of betting. Only in the
                first round (sometimes called the preflop round) does the betting start elsewhere. In all rounds after
                the first, the first player has two choices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check, that is, make no bet</li>
                <li>Bet, that is, make a bet at the proper limit for that round></li>
            </ul>
            <p>If no one bets, each player in turn has the same choices. It is possible in every round except the first
                for no betting to occur. No betting in a round is called being checked around.</p>
            <p>If anyone bets, each succeeding player has three choices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fold</li>
                <li>Call, that is, match the preceding bet</li>
                <li>Raise, that is, increase the preceding bet</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A player who checks retains his cards. If someone bets, when the action returns, a player who checked has
                the preceding three choices. To check and then raise when the betting returns is known, reasonably
                enough, as check-raising. If you check with the intention of raising, you of course risk the possibility
                that no one will bet.</p>
            <h3>The Turn</h3>
            <p>Once the betting for the second round is equalized, that is, once everyone has had an opportunity either
                to check or match the total betting for the round, the dealer deals one more card face up in the center
                of the table. This fourth of the community cards is called the turn.</p>
            <p>The third round of betting takes place. Again, the betting starts with the first active player to the
                left of the button. The betting proceeds exactly the same as the second round. In a limit game, in the
                third round and fourth rounds the betting usually proceeds in increments twice the size of the first two
                rounds.</p>
            <h3>The River</h3>
            <p>Once the betting for the third round is equalized, the dealer deals a fifth and final card face up in the
                center of the table. This last community card is called the river.</p>
            <p>The fourth and final round of betting takes place. Again, the betting starts with the first active player
                to the left of the button. The betting proceeds exactly the same as the two previous rounds.</p>
            <h3>Showdown</h3>
            <p>Once the betting for the fourth round is equalized, the betting is over, and there is a showdown.
                Remaining active players show their cards and the best hand, comprised of the best five cards from among
                each player's combination of two hole cards plus the community cards, wins. The holder of the winning
                hand is awarded the pot. If there is a tie for the best hand, the pot will be split equally among the
                tied players.</p>
            <p>If the betting is not equalized on the final round, that is, one player bet or raised and no one called,
                there is no showdown, and the software awards the pot to the player who made that uncalled bet. This is
                the case on any previous round, as well. If it happens on earlier rounds, no further cards are dealt,
                because the hand is over.
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes a player runs out of chips before all the betting is over. In such case, one or more side pots
                are created, and the software awards appropriate main and side pots. When a player is all in, a bet or
                raise can be made that is not called, but a showdown still takes place.
            </p>
            <p>In determining the winning hand, the combination of five best cards sometimes includes both a player's
                hole cards. Sometimes it includes only one of a player's hole cards. Sometimes, rarely, no hole cards
                are used. In such a case, the board would contain some combination better than any hand that can be made
                using any player's hole cards. This is called playing the board. When all players play the board, the
                pot is split equally among all players remaining in the hand at that point.</p>
